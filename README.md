# Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## Step 1 - Flask API

Used Flask to design an API for my dataset and to serve the HTML and JavaScript required for my dashboard page.
* First, created a template called `index.html` for your dashboard landing page. Used the Bootstrap grid system to create the structure of the dashboard page.

* Next, created the following routes for my api.

```python
@app.route("/")
    """Return the dashboard homepage."""
```
```python
@app.route('/names')
    """List of sample names.

    Returns a list of sample names in the format
    [
        "BB_940",
        "BB_941",
        "BB_943",
        "BB_944",
        "BB_945",
        "BB_946",
        "BB_947",
        ...
    ]

    """
```
```python
@app.route('/otu')
    """List of OTU descriptions.

    Returns a list of OTU descriptions in the following format

    [
        "Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Halobacteria;Halobacteriales;Halobacteriaceae;Halococcus",
        "Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Halobacteria;Halobacteriales;Halobacteriaceae;Halococcus",
        "Bacteria",
        "Bacteria",
        "Bacteria",
        ...
    ]
    """
```
```python
@app.route('/metadata/<sample>')
    """MetaData for a given sample.

    Args: Sample in the format: `BB_940`

    Returns a json dictionary of sample metadata in the format

    {
        AGE: 24,
        BBTYPE: "I",
        ETHNICITY: "Caucasian",
        GENDER: "F",
        LOCATION: "Beaufort/NC",
        SAMPLEID: 940
    }
    """
```
```python
@app.route('/wfreq/<sample>')
    """Weekly Washing Frequency as a number.

    Args: Sample in the format: `BB_940`

    Returns an integer value for the weekly washing frequency `WFREQ`
    """
```
```python
@app.route('/samples/<sample>')
    """OTU IDs and Sample Values for a given sample.

    Sort your Pandas DataFrame (OTU ID and Sample Value)
    in Descending Order by Sample Value

    Return a list of dictionaries containing sorted lists  for `otu_ids`
    and `sample_values`

    [
        {
            otu_ids: [
                1166,
                2858,
                481,
                ...
            ],
            sample_values: [
                163,
                126,
                113,
                ...
            ]
        }
    ]
    """
```

## Step 2 - Plotly.js

Used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for dashboard.

* Used the route `/names` to populate a dropdown select element with the list of sample names.

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## Step 1 - Flask API

Use Flask to design an API for your dataset and to serve the HTML and JavaScript required for your dashboard page. Note: We recommend using the sqlite database file and SQLAlchemy inside of your Flask application code, but you are permitted to read the CSV data directly into Pandas DataFrames for this assignment. You will still need to output the data as JSON in the format specified in the routes below.

* First, create a template called `index.html` for your dashboard landing page. Use the Bootstrap grid system to create the structure of the dashboard page.

* Next, create the following routes for your api.

```python
@app.route("/")
    """Return the dashboard homepage."""
```
```python
@app.route('/names')
    """List of sample names.

    Returns a list of sample names in the format
    [
        "BB_940",
        "BB_941",

        "BB_945",
        "BB_946",

## Step 2 - Plotly.js

Used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for my dashboard.

* Used the route `/names` to populate a dropdown select element with the list of sample names.
* Created a PIE chart that uses data from my routes `/samples/<sample>` and `/otu` to display the top 10 samples.
* Created a Bubble Chart that uses data from your routes `/samples/<sample>` and `/otu` to plot the __Sample Value__ vs the __OTU ID__ for the selected sample.
* Displayed the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`
* Created Gauge Chart to plot the Weekly Washing Frequency obtained from the route `/wfreq/<sample>`
* Deployed the Flask app to Heroku.
